as a car park operator
I want to navigate to the exit in a single floor building
so that I can escape the park

given a single floor building with 10 spaces, an exit on the far right and a random starting position
when we navigate to the exit
then the number of steps should be calculated

Given we are in a car park
and it has only one parking space, and the exit is to the right from the parking space
what steps do I have to take to exit the car park?

##

position 1,4<-
exit 1,0
[[false,false, false,, false false, true],[true, false, false, false, false, false]]

function exit seeker
function position updater & record moves
use a function to get directon, number of moves, and putting moves into the exitInstructions
